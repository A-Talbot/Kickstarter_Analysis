# Kickstarting with Excel

*Prepared for Louise - 2021 JAN 03*

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

* The main purpose of this analysis is to conduct a comparison of the outcomes for KickStarter Campaigns in the "Play" category, specifically, **launch dates** of the campaign and their respective **fundraising goals** will be visualized
* Additionally, limitations and futher analysis targets will be recommended

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch

A dataset consisting of **outcomes** and their respective **launch date** was analysed, and the following graph was produced to help visualize the findings:
![Theatre_Outcomes vs Launch](Theatre_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

*Please note that for the month of **October** there were **no canceled plays**, and therefore there is a gap in the line graph*

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

A dataset consisting of **outcomes** and their respective **launch date** was analysed, and the following chart was produced to help visualize the findings:
![Outcomes vs Goals](Outcomes_vs_Goals.png)

*Please note that for the **entire dataset** there were **no canceled plays**, and therefore there is line present for this outcome*

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
