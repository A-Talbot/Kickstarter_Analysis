# Kickstarting with Excel

*Prepared for Louise - 2021 JAN 03*

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

* The main purpose of this analysis is to conduct a comparison of the outcomes for KickStarter Campaigns in the "Play" category, specifically, **launch dates** of the campaign and their respective **fundraising goals** will be visualized
* Additionally, limitations and futher analysis targets will be recommended

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch

A dataset consisting of **outcomes** and their respective **launch date** was analysed by understanding the amount of successful, canceled, and failed outcomes that were launched during each month. The following graph was produced to help visualize the findings expressed as a total count:
![Theatre_Outcomes vs Launch](Theatre_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

*Please note that for the month of **October** there were **no canceled plays**, and therefore there is a gap in the line graph*

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

A dataset consisting of **outcomes** and their respective **goal** was analysed by understanding the amount of successful, canceled, and failed outcomes that were launched with a spaecifc target range. The following chart was produced to help visualize the findings expressed in percentage:

*Please note that for the **entire dataset** there were **no canceled plays**, and therefore there is line present for this outcome*

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Although no challenges or difficulties were encountered during this analysis, one thing to consider when performing 

## Results

### Conclusions of Analysis

There are three final conclusions based on the analysis of the dataset:
* Campaigns launched in the month of May are far more likely to be successful than other months of the year, specifically speaking May had more than double the amount of successful launches as compared to the number of failed and canceled launches in total
* Campaigns launched in the month of December have roughly the same chance of being successful as they do being unsuccessful/canceled, as there were about the same number of successful launches as there were unsiccessful and canceled launches in total
* With the exception of the $35000 to $45000 goal range, the lower the goal the more likely the campaign is to be successful

### Limitations 

Limitations to keep in mind when reviewing the conclusions:
* This dataset is obtained from *KickStarter* campaigns only, and other crowdfunding paltforms such as *GoFundMe, Indiegogo,* etc. were not consulted
* This dataset consists of campaigns with the category *theatre* and subcategory *plays* and it is assumed that all plays utilized the appropriate labels at both the category and subcategory levels

### Further Study

Additioanl graphs that could be created to further compare the various outcomes of Kickstarter campaigns within the subcategory *plays* include the following:
* Outcomes based on launch date filtered by a specific country or set of countries
* Outcomes based on goal filtered by a specific country or set of countries
* Outcomes based on length of time the campaign was active for
